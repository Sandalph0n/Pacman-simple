-Hi, this is a simple version of the famous Pacman game, created by Khoi Nguyen Vu 
-The main file of this game, where setup() and draw() is placed, is Pacman.pde
-All the code i writed myself, the images ared downloaded on the internet - Reference can be found in the heading of Pacman.pde
-Every text, button, and point are created using 2D shapes, which can be found in graphics.pde
-The notes of the code blocks are also written quite clearly by me, you can find it right on the code block, or next to it.
-Read the Pacman.pde's heading for more information.

Thank you, enjoy :)
